![Fast bubbles around an underwater ruined portal](https://github.com/axialeaa/BlockyBubbles/assets/116074698/c8343ad4-6047-4b33-80a9-a36c667cdfa1)

**Blocky Bubbles** is a [Fabric][fabric] mod that attempts to port Bedrock Edition's fast bubbles feature to Java Edition! It seamlessly integrates into [Sodium][sodium]'s video settings which allow you to configure the quality of bubble columns independently of the main graphics profile.

> [!NOTE]
> Without [Sodium][sodium] installed, **Blocky Bubbles** will use the main graphics quality setting.

I have also obtained permission from miniluv73, the original artist behind the fast bubbles textures for the Bedrock Edition version of [Faithful 32x][faithful], to use his assets inside an in-built resource pack! Simply head to the resource pack menu to upscale **Blocky Bubbles** to double resolution.
***

### Getting Started
**Blocky Bubbles** operates on [Kikugie's fork of Stonecutter][stonecutter-kt], allowing for easy multi-version scheming. Every release will be available for most versions since 1.17, allowing you to get the full experience regardless of your circumstances.

- Make sure you're running a Fabric instance of the game. If you're playing from the vanilla launcher, follow the [Fabric installation guide][fabric-guide]. If you're playing from a third-party launcher like [Prism][prism], you'll need to follow their own instructions which you can often find on their respective websites. For example, [here][prism-guide] is Prism's guide to downloading mods.
- If you're not using a third-party launcher with in-built mod installation, you'll need to download the latest version of **Blocky Bubbles** for your game version from the [GitHub releases][github-releases] page or on [Modrinth][modrinth-versions]. Drag the `.jar` file into your mods folder and launch the game!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Blocky Bubbles** requires [Fabric API][fabric-api]. Without it, the game will fail to start!
