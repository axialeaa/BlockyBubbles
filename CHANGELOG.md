## 🔧 Changes
[Sodium] recently brought about a new config API specifically designed with Sodium addons in mind. With this, I've removed the janky mixin and replaced it with a clean, professional-looking tab in the video settings screen!

In similar news, 1.21.11 removed the Fast, Fancy and Fabulous graphics profiles and turned them into presets for functionally separate, individual options.

You can now configure all the features of **Blocky Bubbles** without Sodium!
