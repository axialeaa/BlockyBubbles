Hey! This is mostly just a trivial update for the Chase The Skies drop and its hotfixes. But first, a solemn announcement...

## 🪦 The End-est of the Lives
I have finally stood up for the part of myself that had been weighed under by the workload of handling multiple game versions at the same time.

For those in the modding scene you'll know it's a pain in the ass to keep up with. For those not in the know: it's incredibly demotivating and shifts my focus away from the quality of the content I make. For this reason, I have decided I will no longer be supporting versions before the most recent release.

I am aware that this will alienate a portion of my consumers: it's simply the only way forward for me to continue enjoying what I do. I am sorry if you're someone who will be affected by this decision. I hope you can continue to enjoy my work!!

## 🔧 Changes
- Updated the mod icon.

## 🐛 Fixes
